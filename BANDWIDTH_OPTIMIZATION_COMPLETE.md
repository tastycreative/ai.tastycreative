# ðŸš€ BANDWIDTH OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY

## Problem Identified
High bandwidth usage on API endpoints:
- `/api/jobs/[jobId]` - 642 requests, 2.57 MB
- `/api/jobs/[jobId]/images` - 398 requests, 1.57 MB

## Root Causes
1. **Aggressive Polling**: Text-to-image page polling every 500ms-1s
2. **No Caching**: Images API called repeatedly without cache
3. **Redundant Auto-refresh**: 3-second intervals even for completed jobs
4. **Multiple Retry Loops**: 5+ retry attempts with short delays

## Optimizations Applied

### âœ… Polling Intervals Reduced
- Job status polling: 500ms â†’ 2-3 seconds
- Error retries: 500ms â†’ 2 seconds  
- Auto-refresh: 3s â†’ 10s (only for incomplete jobs)

### âœ… Caching Added
- 10-second cache for image API calls
- Prevents redundant requests for same job
- Force refresh option for manual requests

### âœ… Auto-refresh Logic Improved
- Only refreshes for `processing` jobs or `completed` jobs missing images
- Stops auto-refresh after successful image fetch for completed jobs
- No refresh for stable/cached jobs

### âœ… Retry Logic Optimized
- Reduced from 5 retries to 2 retries for AWS S3
- Longer intervals: 2s, 5s instead of 0.5s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s
- Optimized for direct AWS S3 URLs (less retry needed)

## Expected Results
- **80-90% reduction** in API bandwidth usage
- **Faster page loads** with AWS S3 direct URLs
- **Better user experience** with proper caching
- **Lower server costs** with reduced API calls

## AWS S3 Direct Benefits
Since images/videos now load directly from AWS S3:
- No Vercel bandwidth usage for media files
- Faster loading times (direct CDN access)
- Reduced API server load
- Better scalability
