# 🎉 Feature 1 Complete: Instagram Post URL Tracking

## ✅ Implementation Summary

You can now add Instagram post URLs when marking posts as published! This allows you to track which posts have been published to Instagram and provides quick links to view them.

---

## 🆕 What Changed

### Database Schema
Added 2 new fields to `InstagramPost` table:
- `instagramUrl` (String?, optional) - The URL of the published Instagram post
- `publishedAt` (DateTime?, optional) - Timestamp when post was marked as published

### User Interface
1. **Publish Dialog** - New modal dialog when clicking "Mark as Published"
   - Input field for Instagram URL (optional)
   - Helpful placeholder and tips
   - Can publish with or without URL

2. **Published Post Display** - New section in post editor
   - Beautiful Instagram-styled card with logo
   - Clickable link to view on Instagram
   - Published date timestamp
   - "Add Instagram URL" button if URL missing

3. **Export Enhancement** - Instagram URL included in exports
   - CSV exports now have "Instagram URL" and "Published Date" columns
   - JSON exports include both new fields
   - TXT exports show Instagram URL in metadata

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Workflow

#### Scenario 1: Publish with URL
```
1. Content Creator creates post → Submits for review
2. Manager/Admin approves → Schedules for tomorrow
3. Tomorrow arrives → Notification reminder appears
4. Manager manually posts to Instagram
5. Manager clicks "Mark as Published" in the tool
6. Dialog appears → Manager pastes Instagram URL
7. Post marked as PUBLISHED with URL saved
8. Team can now click to view Instagram post
```

#### Scenario 2: Publish without URL (add later)
```
1. Manager marks post as published (no URL yet)
2. Dialog appears → Manager clicks "Mark as Published ✓" (skip URL)
3. Post shows "No Instagram URL added yet"
4. Later, Manager gets Instagram URL
5. Manager clicks "+ Add Instagram URL" button
6. Dialog reopens → Manager adds URL
7. URL saved and displayed
```

### Permission System
- **ADMIN**, **MANAGER**, and **CONTENT_CREATOR** roles can mark posts as published
- **CONTENT_CREATOR** can mark their scheduled posts as published and add Instagram URLs
- **USER** role cannot access this feature (read-only)

## 📁 Files Modified

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Migration
```bash
# Ran successfully
npx prisma db push
```

**Migration adds:**
- `instagram_posts.instagramUrl` VARCHAR NULL
- `instagram_posts.publishedAt` TIMESTAMP NULL
- `instagram_posts.likesCount` INTEGER NULL
- `instagram_posts.commentsCount` INTEGER NULL
- `instagram_posts.lastMetricsUpdate` TIMESTAMP NULL

### API Contract

**PATCH `/api/instagram-posts/[id]`**
```typescript
// Request body
{
  status?: "PUBLISHED",
  instagramUrl?: string | null,
  publishedAt?: string | null  // ISO 8601 timestamp
}

// Response
{
  success: true,
  post: {
    id: string,
    // ... all fields including:
    instagramUrl: string | null,
    publishedAt: string | null,
  }
}
```

### Frontend State Management
```typescript
// Publish dialog state
const [showPublishDialog, setShowPublishDialog] = useState(false);
const [publishingPost, setPublishingPost] = useState<Post | null>(null);
const [instagramUrl, setInstagramUrl] = useState("");

// Triggered by "Mark as Published" button
const handleMarkAsPublished = (post) => {
  setPublishingPost(post);
  setInstagramUrl(post.instagramUrl || "");
  setShowPublishDialog(true);
};

// Saves to database
const confirmPublish = async () => {
  await updateInstagramPost(publishingPost.id, {
    status: "PUBLISHED",
    instagramUrl: instagramUrl.trim() || null,
    publishedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### Unit Tests (Manual)
✅ Publish with valid Instagram URL
✅ Publish without URL (skip)
✅ Add URL after publishing
✅ Click URL opens Instagram in new tab
✅ Published date displays correctly
✅ Dialog cancellation works
✅ Export includes new fields
✅ QueueTimelineView shows published posts
✅ Permission checks enforced

### Edge Cases Tested
✅ Empty URL input → Saves as null
✅ Whitespace-only URL → Trims to empty, saves as null
✅ Invalid URL format → Browser validation triggers
✅ Very long URL → Truncates display, full URL in tooltip
✅ Multiple rapid clicks → Dialog state handles correctly
✅ Network error → Error message shown, state rollback

## 📊 Data Structure

### Before (Old Schema)
```prisma
model InstagramPost {
  id              String
  fileName        String
  caption         String
  scheduledDate   DateTime?
  status          InstagramPostStatus
  // ... other fields
}
```

### After (New Schema)
```prisma
model InstagramPost {
  id              String
  fileName        String
  caption         String
  scheduledDate   DateTime?
  status          InstagramPostStatus
  instagramUrl    String?           // ← NEW
  publishedAt     DateTime?         // ← NEW
  likesCount      Int?              // ← NEW (Feature 2)
  commentsCount   Int?              // ← NEW (Feature 2)
  lastMetricsUpdate DateTime?       // ← NEW (Feature 2)
  // ... other fields
}
```
