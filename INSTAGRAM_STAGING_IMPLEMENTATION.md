# Instagram Staging Tool - Database Integration Complete âœ…

## Summary of Implementation

### 1. **Database Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
Created new `InstagramPost` model with:
- User association (clerkId)
- Google Drive file tracking (driveFileId, driveFileUrl, fileName)
- Post metadata (caption, scheduledDate, status, postType)
- Organization (folder, order for drag-drop)
- Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

**Enums:**
- `InstagramPostStatus`: DRAFT, REVIEW, APPROVED, SCHEDULED, PUBLISHED
- `PostType`: POST, REEL, STORY

### 2. **API Endpoints**

#### `/api/instagram-posts` (GET, POST, PATCH)
- **GET**: Fetch all posts for authenticated user (ordered by `order` field)
- **POST**: Create new post in database
- **PATCH**: Update posts order (bulk operation for drag-drop)

#### `/api/instagram-posts/[id]` (GET, PATCH, DELETE)
- **GET**: Fetch single post
- **PATCH**: Update post (caption, scheduledDate, status, postType)
- **DELETE**: Delete post from database + optionally from Google Drive

### 3. **Utility Functions** (`lib/instagram-posts.ts`)
Type-safe utility functions:
- `fetchInstagramPosts()` - Get all posts
- `createInstagramPost(data)` - Create new post
- `updateInstagramPost(id, updates)` - Update post
- `deleteInstagramPost(id, options)` - Delete post
- `updatePostsOrder(posts)` - Sync drag-drop order

### 4. **Component Integration** (`components/social-media/InstagramStagingTool.tsx`)

#### **On Mount:**
1. Load posts from database
2. Load blob URLs for post images from Google Drive
3. Restore user's staging queue state

#### **Add to Queue:**
1. User clicks "Add to Queue" on Google Drive file
2. Creates post in database first
3. Adds to local state with database ID
4. Persists across page refreshes

#### **Edit Post:**
1. User edits caption, date, or status
2. Updates local state immediately (responsive UI)
3. Saves changes to database in background
4. Shows error if save fails

#### **Drag & Drop:**
1. User drags post to new position
2. Updates order locally immediately
3. Bulk updates all post orders in database
4. Maintains order across page refreshes

#### **Delete Post:**
1. User clicks delete button
2. Shows confirmation dialog with option to delete from Google Drive
3. Deletes from database (required)
4. Optionally deletes from Google Drive
5. Removes from local state
6. Success/error feedback

### 5. **User Isolation**
All operations are user-specific:
- Posts filtered by `clerkId` from Clerk authentication
- Users only see their own posts
- Complete data isolation between users

### 6. **Google Drive Integration**
- User-specific subfolders in Google Drive
- Files organized by userId within each main folder
- Delete functionality removes from both database and Google Drive (optional)
