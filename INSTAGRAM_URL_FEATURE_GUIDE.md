## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
**File:** `components/social-media/InstagramStagingTool.tsx`

1. **Post Interface Updated:**
   ```typescript
   interface Post {
     // ... existing fields
     instagramUrl?: string | null;
     publishedAt?: string | null;
   }
   ```

2. **New State Variables:**
   ```typescript
   const [showPublishDialog, setShowPublishDialog] = useState(false);
   const [publishingPost, setPublishingPost] = useState<Post | null>(null);
   const [instagramUrl, setInstagramUrl] = useState("");
   ```

3. **New Function:**
   ```typescript
   const confirmPublish = async () => {
     await updateInstagramPost(post.id, {
       status: "PUBLISHED",
       instagramUrl: instagramUrl.trim() || null,
       publishedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
     });
   }
   ```

### Backend Changes
**File:** `app/api/instagram-posts/[id]/route.ts`

**Added to PATCH endpoint:**
```typescript
const { instagramUrl, publishedAt } = body;

data: {
  ...(instagramUrl !== undefined && { instagramUrl }),
  ...(publishedAt !== undefined && { 
    publishedAt: publishedAt ? new Date(publishedAt) : null 
  }),
}
```
