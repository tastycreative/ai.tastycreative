### 4. **USER** (Gray Badge)

## 🚀 How to Use

### For CONTENT_CREATORS:
1. Add image from Google Drive to feed
2. Write caption and set date
3. Click **"Submit for Review"** button
4. Wait for Manager/Admin approval

### For MANAGERS/ADMINS:
1. Review posts marked as **REVIEW**

3. If approved, set final schedule date
4. Click **"Mark as Scheduled"**

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Set User Roles in Clerk

Go to Clerk Dashboard → Users → Select User → Public Metadata:

```json
{
  "role": "MANAGER"
}
```

Options: `"ADMIN"`, `"MANAGER"`, `"CONTENT_CREATOR"`, `"USER"`

See **CLERK_ROLES_SETUP.md** for detailed instructions.

### 2. Test the System

Create test users with different roles:
- Test CONTENT_CREATOR: Can submit but not approve
- Test MANAGER: Can approve and schedule
- Test USER: Gets access denied

### 3. Set Default Role

For new signups, set default role to `"USER"` so they don't get access to the staging tool automatically.

3. **Default role**: New users should be `"USER"` by default
4. **Access control**: Tool checks role before rendering content
