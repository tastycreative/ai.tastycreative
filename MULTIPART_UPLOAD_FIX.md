# Multipart Upload Session Persistence Fix

## Problem Summary

The multipart upload was failing with the error:
```
Missing parts: expected 656, got 213
```

### Root Cause
The original implementation used **file-based session storage** (`/tmp/multipart-sessions`) which doesn't work on Vercel's serverless infrastructure because:
1. Each request can hit a different serverless instance
2. The `/tmp` directory is not shared between instances
3. Session data was being lost between part uploads
4. Only some parts were being tracked when completing the upload

## Solution

### Database-Based Session Storage
Migrated from file-based storage to **PostgreSQL database storage** using Prisma:

1. **New Prisma Model**: `MultipartUploadSession`
   - Stores session data persistently across all serverless instances
   - Tracks all uploaded parts with their ETags
   - Includes automatic expiration (24 hours)
   - Indexed for fast lookups

2. **Updated API Route**: `/api/user/influencers/multipart-s3-upload/route.ts`
   - Replaced file operations with database queries
   - All serverless instances now share the same session state
   - Parts are never lost between requests

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
```prisma
model MultipartUploadSession {
  id               String   @id @default(cuid())
  sessionId        String   @unique
  clerkId          String
  uploadId         String
  s3Key            String
  uniqueFileName   String
  totalParts       Int
  uploadedParts    Json     @default("[]")
  createdAt        DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt        DateTime @updatedAt
  expiresAt        DateTime

  @@index([sessionId])
  @@index([clerkId])
  @@index([expiresAt])
  @@map("multipart_upload_sessions")
}
```

#### 2. API Route Updates
- **Removed**: File system operations (`fs`, `path` modules)
- **Added**: Prisma client for database operations
- **Updated**: `saveSession()`, `loadSession()`, `deleteSession()` functions
- **Features**:
  - Session persistence across all serverless instances
  - Automatic session expiration (24 hours)
  - Session reconstruction capability
  - Better error handling and logging

### Benefits

✅ **Reliable Part Tracking**: All parts are tracked correctly across instances
✅ **Scalability**: Works perfectly with Vercel's distributed infrastructure  
✅ **Data Persistence**: Session data survives between requests
✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired sessions are detected and removed
✅ **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

### How It Works Now

1. **Start Upload** → Session created in database
2. **Upload Part 1-656** → Each part update is saved to database
3. **Complete Upload** → All parts verified from database
4. **Success** → Session cleaned up from database

### Testing

To test the fix:

1. Upload a large LoRA file (>300MB)
2. Monitor the console logs:
   - ✅ Session saved to database
   - ✅ Parts tracked: X/656
   - ✅ Upload completed successfully

### Maintenance

The database table will grow over time. Consider:
- Setting up a cron job to clean up expired sessions
- Monitoring table size periodically

### Database Cleanup (Optional)

To manually clean up expired sessions:
```sql
DELETE FROM multipart_upload_sessions 
WHERE "expiresAt" < NOW();
```

## Migration Applied

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Database synchronized and Prisma client regenerated successfully.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and Deployed
**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Impact**: All large file uploads (LoRA models, etc.)
