## 🎯 Feature 2: Admin/Manager Notifications

### What's New
When a **CONTENT_CREATOR** marks a post as published, all **ADMINS** and **MANAGERS** get notified!

### Notification Types

#### With Instagram URL
```
🎉 Post Published with Link!
John Doe published "summer_vibes.jpg" and added the Instagram link
```

#### Without Instagram URL
```
📸 Post Published
John Doe published "summer_vibes.jpg" (no Instagram link yet)
```

### Features
- 📬 **Automatic notifications** - No manual work needed
- 👥 **All admins/managers notified** - Team stays in sync
- 🔗 **Clickable link** - Takes you directly to the post
- 📊 **Metadata included** - Post ID, filename, URL, publisher info
- 🔕 **Self-excluded** - If admin publishes, they don't notify themselves

### Workflow Example
```
1. Content Creator posts to Instagram
2. Content Creator marks as PUBLISHED in tool
3. Content Creator adds Instagram URL
4. ✨ NOTIFICATION SENT to all admins/managers:
   "🎉 Post Published with Link!"
5. Admin clicks notification → Opens post
6. Admin sees Instagram URL and clicks to verify
```

### When Notifications Are Sent
✅ Content Creator marks post as PUBLISHED  
✅ Sent to ALL admins and managers  
✅ Includes whether Instagram URL was added  
❌ NOT sent if admin/manager marks it (they already know!)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
**File:** `components/social-media/InstagramStagingTool.tsx`

#### 1. Instagram Indicator Badge
```tsx
{post.status === "PUBLISHED" && post.instagramUrl && (
  <a
    href={post.instagramUrl}
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
    className="absolute top-2 right-2 bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-500 to-pink-500 hover:from-purple-600 hover:to-pink-600 text-white rounded-full p-2 shadow-lg transition-all hover:scale-110 z-20"
    title="View on Instagram"
  >
    <svg className="w-4 h-4" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
      {/* Instagram logo SVG */}
    </svg>
  </a>
)}
```

**Placement:** After REEL indicator, before status badge
**Condition:** Only shows if `status === "PUBLISHED" && instagramUrl exists`
**Click behavior:** Opens Instagram, prevents post editor from opening

#### 2. Admin Notification on Publish
```tsx
// In confirmPublish function
if (userRole === "CONTENT_CREATOR") {
  await fetch('/api/notifications/notify-admins', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      type: 'POST_PUBLISHED',
      postId: publishingPost.id,
      fileName: publishingPost.fileName,
      instagramUrl: hasUrl ? instagramUrl.trim() : null,
      publishedAt: now,
    }),
  });
}
```

**When:** After post is successfully marked as PUBLISHED
**Who:** Only content creators trigger this (not admins/managers)
**Error handling:** Notification failure doesn't break publish operation

### Backend Changes
**File:** `app/api/notifications/notify-admins/route.ts` (NEW)

```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Get all admins and managers
  const adminsAndManagers = await prisma.user.findMany({
    where: { role: { in: ['ADMIN', 'MANAGER'] } }
  });

  // 2. Get publisher info
  const publisher = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { clerkId: userId }
  });

  // 3. Create notifications for each admin/manager
  await Promise.all(adminsAndManagers.map(admin => {
    if (admin.clerkId === userId) return null; // Skip self
    
    return prisma.notification.create({
      data: {
        userId: admin.id,
        type: 'SYSTEM',
        title: hasUrl ? '🎉 Post Published with Link!' : '📸 Post Published',
        message: `${publisherName} published "${fileName}" ${hasUrl ? 'and added the Instagram link' : '(no Instagram link yet)'}`,
        link: `/dashboard/social-media?post=${postId}`,
        metadata: { postId, fileName, instagramUrl, publishedAt, publisherId },
      }
    });
  }));
}
```

**Permissions:** Any authenticated user (but only called by content creators)
**Database:** Creates notification records in `notifications` table
**Returns:** Success status + count of notifications sent
