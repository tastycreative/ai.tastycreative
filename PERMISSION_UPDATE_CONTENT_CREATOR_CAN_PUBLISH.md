## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test 1: Content Creator Marks Own Post
- [x] CONTENT_CREATOR creates post
- [x] ADMIN/MANAGER schedules it
- [x] CONTENT_CREATOR can see "Mark as Published" button
- [x] CONTENT_CREATOR can open publish dialog
- [x] CONTENT_CREATOR can add Instagram URL
- [x] Post marked as PUBLISHED successfully

### Test 2: Content Creator Adds URL Later
- [x] CONTENT_CREATOR marks post as published (no URL)
- [x] "+ Add Instagram URL" button appears
- [x] CONTENT_CREATOR clicks button
- [x] Dialog reopens
- [x] URL can be added

### Test 3: Permissions Still Enforced
- [x] USER role cannot see "Mark as Published" button
- [x] CONTENT_CREATOR cannot approve posts (still ❌)
- [x] CONTENT_CREATOR cannot schedule posts (still ❌)
- [x] Only marking as published is allowed

---

## 💡 Why This Makes Sense

**Business Logic:**
- Content creators are the ones posting to Instagram
- They have the Instagram URL immediately after posting
- Empowers them to track their own work
- Reduces manager workload
- Faster turnaround time

**Permissions Maintained:**
- Still can't approve (ADMIN/MANAGER only)
- Still can't schedule (ADMIN/MANAGER only)
- Only marks as published (final step they perform anyway)

## 🔧 Technical Changes

**File Modified:** `components/social-media/InstagramStagingTool.tsx`

**Line 44 - Before:**
```typescript
const canPublish = (role: UserRole) => role === "ADMIN" || role === "MANAGER";
```

**Line 44 - After:**
```typescript
const canPublish = (role: UserRole) => 
  role === "ADMIN" || role === "MANAGER" || role === "CONTENT_CREATOR";
```

**Impact:**
- All UI elements checking `canPublish(userRole)` now allow CONTENT_CREATOR
- "Mark as Published" button now visible to CONTENT_CREATOR
- Publish dialog accessible to CONTENT_CREATOR
- No backend changes needed (API already accepts from any authenticated user)
