echo "üß™ Testing Webhook Fix for NGrok Integration"
echo "============================================"

echo "üìã Issue identified:"
echo "   - RunPod was getting 404 errors when calling ngrok webhook"
echo "   - NGrok requires 'ngrok-skip-browser-warning' header"
echo "   - handler.py was not including this header"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Fix applied:"
echo "   - Updated send_webhook() function in handler.py"
echo "   - Added 'ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true' header"
echo "   - Added 'User-Agent: RunPod-AI-Toolkit/1.0' for identification"
echo "   - Built new Docker image: v1.0.14"
echo ""

echo "üß™ Testing webhook endpoints:"

echo "1. Testing GET request (health check):"
response1=$(curl -s https://87abaec1e191.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/training2/test-job)

echo "2. Testing POST with ngrok header (simulating fixed RunPod request):"
